## Adding links
I'll add links when I find new ones, feel free to PR if you want to contribute. I'm not planning to remove those links even if they won't work anymore, I doubt Discord/Steam will buy those fake domains for official purposes.

## Usage
You might use those urls for a blacklist bot, which I am working on myself. There is also a [Pi-Hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole) file which you can use to block them with your Pi-Hole DNS.
